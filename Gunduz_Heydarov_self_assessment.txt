For the CVE-ID Search project, I used my web development skills to create something valuable. 
Using Django, a Python framework, I built the project's foundation. 
Tools like Selenium and Beautifulsoup helped me gather data from the web pages. 
During the month I also collect functions, datas from my groupmades and 
merge this to the project. Finally, I deployed the project online using Docker and Nginx.
