Part of the work i have done consists of the creating pdf file from the nist and exploitdb. These Python functions, create_pdf_from_nist_url and create_pdf_from_exploitdb_url, are designed to generate PDF documents by extracting information from specific web pages.
The create_pdf_from_nist_url function extracts vulnerability details from NIST pages. It utilizes Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup to navigate and parse HTML content. The information extracted includes the vulnerability title, description, references, and affected software configurations. It constructs a structured PDF document containing this information.
Similarly, the create_pdf_from_exploitdb_url function scrapes exploit information from Exploit Database pages. It extracts exploit titles, statuses, and download links from tables on the webpage using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The extracted data is structured into a PDF document, enabling the automation of exploit documentation from the Exploit Database website.
Both functions include error handling to manage exceptions encountered during the scraping process. They serve as effective tools for automating the extraction and documentation of vulnerability and exploit information from relevant web sources, enhancing efficiency in cybersecurity analysis and reporting tasks.
