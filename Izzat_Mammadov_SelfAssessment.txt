Through this project, which lasted for about a month, I learned the Python language, the working principle of functions, what CVE is, and also how to retrieve data from a web page in JSON or HTML type, and how to take parts that are needed from these data. Although my groupmate Gunduz did most of the job during the project, he did not spare us his knowledge. From the moment we first divide the task into parts for the group until the last moment when the result of the task is gathered, he hard work in everything. What I did in Taksk was to check the correctness of the inputted CVE, if it meets the CVE conditions, I found out the existence of this CVE number made an API request through the request library, and found out its status via JSON data. I wrote this entire process as a function and sent it to Gunduz to use in our final project.
Finally, I think everyone in the group did their part well and worked hard as individuals.
